# Non-root user for security purposes.
#
# UIDs below 10,000 are a security risk, as a container breakout could result
# in the container being ran as a more privileged user on the host kernel with
# the same UID. Static GID/UID is also useful for chown'ing files outside the container
# where such a user does not exist.

# Install packages here
# bind-tools is needed for DNS resolution to work in *some* Docker networks, but not all.
